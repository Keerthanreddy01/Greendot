# Contributing to GreenDot

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We welcome issues, discussions, and pull requests that improve GreenDot.

## Ways to Contribute
- Report bugs and usability issues
- Propose and implement features
- Improve documentation and translations
- Optimize performance and testing

## Getting Started
1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`:
   - `git checkout -b feature/short-description`
2. Install dependencies:
   - `flutter pub get`
3. Run locally:
   - `flutter run`
4. Ensure code builds for Android and iOS (where applicable).

## Pull Request Guidelines
- Keep PRs focused and small; separate unrelated changes
- Include a clear description of the problem and the solution
- Add screenshots or screen recordings for UI changes
- Add tests where practical (widget/unit)
- Ensure `flutter analyze` passes and no lints are introduced
- Link related issues using `Closes #<issue-number>`

## Commit Message Conventions
- Use descriptive messages, e.g. `feat(ai): add offline TFLite model loader`
- Common prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`

## Coding Standards
- Prefer readable, well-named variables and functions
- Avoid deep nesting; use early returns
- Document non-obvious logic and edge cases
- Keep UI responsive; avoid blocking the UI thread

## Issue Reporting

- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Screenshots/logs if relevant
- Device/OS/Flutter versions
